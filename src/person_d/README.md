# Person D - Search Algorithm Developer

## Responsibilities
- Implement an additional solving algorithm that runs if AC-3 doesn't solve the puzzle:
  - e.g., Backtracking Search, Forward Checking, or MRV heuristic
- Integrate this extension with the AC-3 output so that partially reduced domains can be used
- Ensure final output clearly distinguishes whether the puzzle was solved by AC-3 alone or required the second algorithm

## Deliverables
- `solver_extension.py`
- Report section: Additional Algorithm Implementation (Backtracking / MRV)

## Marks Allocation
Part IV â€“ Additional Algorithm Implementation: **20 marks**
