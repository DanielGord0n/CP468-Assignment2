# Person A - CSP Model Designer (Daniel)

## Responsibilities
- Represent the Sudoku puzzle as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem:
  - Define variables (81 cells)
  - Define domains (values 1–9)
  - Define binary constraints between related cells (same row, column, or subgrid)
- Write the section of the report explaining how Sudoku is modeled as a CSP
- Include a concise mathematical or pseudocode description of the constraint relationships
- Coordinate with Person B to ensure the CSP structure integrates smoothly with the AC-3 implementation

## Deliverables
- `csp_model.py`
- Report section: Sudoku as a CSP (Variables, Domains, Constraints)

## Marks Allocation
Part I – CSP Representation: **20 marks**
